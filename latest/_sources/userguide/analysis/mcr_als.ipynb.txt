    "MCR-ALS (standing for Multivariate Curve Resolution - Alternating Least Squares) is a popular method for resolving a\n",
    "set (or several sets) of spectra $X$ of an evolving mixture (or a set of mixtures) into the spectra $S^t$ of 'pure'\n",
    "species and their concentration profiles $C$. In term of matrix equation:\n",

    "The ALS algorithm allows applying soft or hard constraints (e.g. non negativity, unimodality, equality to a given\n",
